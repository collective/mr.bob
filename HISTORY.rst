  [Domen Kožar]

- ``Question`` does no longer raise error if unknown parameter is passed from a
  config file. Instead those parameters are saved to ``question.extra`` that can
  be later inspected and validated. This is first step to have advanced question
  types such as question with a set of predefined answers
  [Domen Kožar]

- Rewrite all py.test stuff to nosetests, so we have unified testing now. This
  also fixes flake8 segfaults on pypy
